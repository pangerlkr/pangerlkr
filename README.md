## Writing & Thought Leadership

Author of *Unleashing the Dark Side of Technology: A Guide to Cyber Security*  
A practitioner’s guide to cybersecurity from a hacker’s perspective.

Topics I write and speak about:
- Phishing and Social Engineering in the Indian context  
- Cybercrime trends in Tier-2 and Tier-3 regions  
- Digital hygiene for institutions and paramilitary forces  
- The uncomfortable gap between policy and practice  

I publish regularly on LinkedIn and during Cyber Awareness Month, because silence helps attackers.

## Philosophy

I do not believe cybersecurity is a product.  
It is a habit.  
And habits, once neglected, turn predatory.
